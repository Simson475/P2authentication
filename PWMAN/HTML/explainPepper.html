        <h3>What is Pepper?</h3>
    </header>

    <p id="explanation"> Pepper is a unique sequence of characters, used to mask your password. Masking the password, prevent other people from using your login info. 
        This extension only generates a pepper once and stores it locally on your device. 
        The pepper is only saved locally on your device, this means that you will not be able login with the same account on other devices.
        If you want to login on other devices, you can export this pepper from your original device, and import it on the new device. This can be done in the settings menu.
        Be sure that other people do not see your pepper!
